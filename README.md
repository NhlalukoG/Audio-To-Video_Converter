# Audio-To-Video_Converter
This script does batch conversion of audio files in one or sub-directories to video.

It transverses a directory and convert all mp3 files to mp4 by using FFMPEG. Video is made by combination of Logo & audio file.

Image has to be JPEG for now & audio file is MP3 or WMA. Can edit script to support more formats

Usage

  ./converter ~/home/Music
